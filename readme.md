# CA216 Operating Systems: myshell

## Introduction

This is the repository for the CA216 Operating Systems project entitled `myshell`.

## Description

We had to create a shell interpreter in C. The shell has its own internal commands and also allows external commands. For some help, see the documentation in the manual folder or run the shell and type `help`


## How to run the shell

First cd into the src folder and type `make`;
Then cd back to the bin directory and type `./myshell` or `./myshell {BATCHFILE}`. 
It can be the path to a batch file!
